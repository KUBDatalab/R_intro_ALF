## What is R? What is RStudio?

`R` is a programming language. You can use R to create, harvest, clean, analyse and visualise data. The term "`R`" is used to refer to both the programming language and the software that interprets the scripts written using R.


[RStudio](https://rstudio.com) is a user interface for working with R. It is called an Integrated Development Environment (IDE): a piece of software that provides tools to make programming easier. You can use R without RStudio, but it's much more limiting. RStudio makes it easier to import datasets, create and write scripts, and makes using R much more effective. To function correctly, RStudio needs R and therefore both need to be installed on your computer.

## Why learn R?

### R does not involve lots of pointing and clicking, and that's a good thing

The learning curve might be steep, but with R, the results of your analysis do not rely on remembering a succession of pointing and clicking, but instead on a series of written commands that you can save in a script and run over and over again.

### R code is great for reproducibility

This means that someone else (including your future self) can obtain the same results from the same dataset (or a dataset with added data) when running a saved script.


### R works on data of all shapes and sizes

R can connect to spreadsheets, databases, and many other data formats, on your computer or on the web.


### R is free and has a large and welcoming community

R is free and open source. There is a large community willing to help you through mailing lists and websites such as [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/), or on the [RStudio community](https://community.rstudio.com/).

Because R is open source and is supported by a large community of developers and users, there is a very large selection of third-party add-on packages which are freely available to extend R's native capabilities.

## Knowing your way around RStudio

Let's start by learning about [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/), which is an
Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for working with R.

The RStudio IDE open-source product is free under the
[Affero General Public License (AGPL) v3](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.en.html).
The RStudio IDE is also available with a commercial license and priority email
support from RStudio, Inc.

We will use the RStudio IDE to write code, navigate files on our computer,
inspect the variables we create, and visualize the plots we generate. RStudio 
can also be used for other things (e.g., version control, developing packages, 
writing Shiny apps) that we will not cover during the workshop. 

One of the advantages of using RStudio is that all the information
you need to write code is available in a single window. Additionally, RStudio 
provides many shortcuts, autocompletion, and highlighting for the major file 
types you use while developing in R. RStudio makes typing easier and less
error-prone.

### Create a new project
Let us start by making a project. A project gives you a

* first open RStudio
* Under the `File` menu, click on `New project`, choose `New directory`, then
`New project`
* Enter the name `library_carpentry` for this new folder (or "directory"). This
will be your **working directory** for the rest of the day.
* Click on `Create project`
* Create a new file where we will type our scripts. Go to File > New File > R
script. Click the save icon on your toolbar and save your script as
"`script.R`".
  
### The RStudio Interface  
Let's take a quick tour of RStudio.

<figure>
<img src="../fig/RStudioPanes.png" title="R Studio" alt="R Studio" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />
</figure>

RStudio is divided into four "panes". The placement of these
panes and their content can be customized (see menu, Tools -> Global Options ->
Pane Layout).  

The Default Layout is:
- **Console Pane** (bottom left)
You use this to type in a command and press enter to immediately
evaluate it. It includes a `>` symbol and a blinking cursor prompting you to
enter some code. Code that you type directly in the console will not be saved,
though it is available in the History Pane. You can try it out by typing `2 + 2`
into the console.

- **Script Pane** (top left) 
This is sort of like a text editor, or a place to draft and save code. You then
tell RStudio to run the line of code, or multiple lines of code, and you can see
it appear in the console as it is running. Then save the script as a .R file for
future use, or to share with others.

- **Environment/History Pane** (top right)
This will display the objects that you've read into what is called the "global
environment." When you read a file into R, or manually create an R object, it
enters into the computer's working memory. When we manipulate or run operations
on that data, it isn't written to a file until we tell it to. It is kept here in
the RStudio environment. The History tab displays all commands that have been
executed in the console.

- **Navigation Pane** (bottom right)
This pane has multiple functions:

    * **Files:** Navigate to files saved on your computer and in your working directory
    * **Plots:** View plots (e.g. charts and graphs) you have created
    * **Packages:** view add-on packages you have installed, or install new packages
    * **Help:** Read help pages for R functions
    * **Viewer:** View local web content

## Interacting with R

The basis of programming is that we write down instructions for the computer to
follow, and then we tell the computer to follow those instructions. We write, or
*code*, instructions in R because it is a common language that both the computer
and we can understand.

You can use R like a calculator:

~~~
2 + 2    # Type 2 + 2 in the console to run the command
~~~
{: .language-r}

While in the console, you can press the up and down keys on your keyboard to cycle through previously executed commands.


Because we want our code and workflow to be reproducible, it is better to type
the commands we want in the script editor and save the script. This way, there
is a complete record of what we did, and anyone (including our future selves!)
can easily replicate the results on their computer.

RStudio allows you to execute commands directly from the script editor by using
the <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Enter</kbd> shortcut (on Mac, <kbd>Cmd</kbd> +
<kbd>Return</kbd> will work). The command on the current line in the
script (indicated by the cursor) or all of the commands in
selected text will be sent to the console and executed when you press
<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Enter</kbd>. If there is information in the console
you do not need anymore, you can clear it with <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>L</kbd>.
You can find other keyboard shortcuts in this
[RStudio cheatsheet about the RStudio IDE](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/raw/master/rstudio-ide.pdf).

## Installing additional packages using the packages tab

When you download R it already has a number of functions built in: these
encompass what is called **Base R.** However, many R users write their own
**libraries** of functions, package them together in **R Packages**, and provide
them to the R community at no charge. This extends the capacity of R and allows
us to do much more. In many cases, they improve on the Base R functions by
making them easier and more straightforward to use. In the course of this lesson
we will be making use of several of these packages, such as `ggplot2` and
`dplyr`.

The [Comprehensive R Archive Network
(CRAN)](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/available_packages_by_name.html)
is the main repository for R packages, and that organization maintains [strict
standards](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/policies.html) in order for a
package to be listed--for example, it must include clear descriptions of the
functions, and it must not track or tamper with the user's R session. See [this
page from
RStudio](https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/201057987-Quick-list-of-useful-R-packages)
for a good list of useful R packages. In addition to CRAN, R users can make
their code and packages available from [GitHub](https://github.com/trending/r).
Finally, some communities host their own collections of R packages, such as
[Bioconductor](https://bioconductor.org/) for computational biology and
bioinformatics.

## Installing Packages

Installing CRAN packages can be done from the RStudio console. Click the
Packages tab in the Navigation Pane, then click Install and search for the
package you're looking for. You can also use the `install.packages()` function
directly in the console. Run `help(install.packages)` to learn more about how to
do it this way.

<figcaption>

At the bottom of the Install Packages window is a check box to
‘Install’ dependencies. This is ticked by default, which is usually
what you want. Packages can (and do) make use of functionality
built into other packages, so for the functionality contained in
the package you are installing to work properly, there may be other
packages which have to be installed with them. The ‘Install
dependencies’ option makes sure that this happens.

> ## Exercise
>
> Use the install option from the packages tab to install the ‘tidyverse’ package.
> 
> > ## Solution
> > From the packages tab, click ‘Install’ from the toolbar and type ‘tidyverse’ into the textbox, then click ‘install’.
> > The ‘tidyverse’ package is really a package of packages, including 'ggplot2' and 'dplyr', both of which require other packages to run correctly. All of these packages will be installed automatically. 
> > Depending on what packages have previously been installed in your R environment, the install of ‘tidyverse’ could be very quick or could take several minutes.
> > As the install proceeds, messages relating to its progress will be written to the console. You will be able to see all of the packages which are actually being installed.
> {: .solution}
{: .challenge}

Because the install process accesses the CRAN repository, you
will need an Internet connection to install packages.

It is also possible to install packages from other repositories, as
well as Github or the local file system, but we won’t be looking at these options in this lesson.

## Installing additional packages using R code

If you were watching the console window when you started the
install of ‘tidyverse’, you may have noticed that the line


~~~
install.packages("tidyverse")
~~~
{: .language-r}

was written to the console before the start of the installation messages.

You could also have installed the **`tidyverse`** packages by running this command directly in the R console.
